# 👥 HR Analytics — Employee Attrition & Performance Study

> A comprehensive HR data analytics project studying **why employees leave**, which departments are at highest risk, and how to predict attrition using Machine Learning — built to demonstrate business-critical analytical skills.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Employee attrition costs companies 6–9 months of an employee's salary in recruiting and training. This project helps HR teams:
- Understand **which employees are most likely to leave**
- Identify **root causes of attrition**
- Build an **ML model to predict attrition** before it happens
- Provide **actionable HR recommendations**

## 📊 Key Findings

### 🔴 Attrition Risk Factors
| Factor | Attrition Rate |
|---|---|
| Low Job Satisfaction (1–2) | ~65%+ |
| Works Overtime | ~2× higher than non-OT |
| Tenure ≤ 2 Years | ~40%+ |
| Poor Work-Life Balance | ~50%+ |

### 📈 Model Performance
| Model | Accuracy | AUC Score |
|---|---|---|
| Random Forest | ~80% | ~0.85 |
| **Gradient Boosting** | **~82%** | **~0.87** |

### 💡 Top HR Recommendations
1. **Reduce overtime** — OT nearly doubles attrition risk
2. **Stay interviews** for employees with satisfaction < 3
3. **Strengthen onboarding** for first 2 years of tenure
4. **Salary review** in highest-attrition departments
5. **Flexible work policy** to improve work-life balance
